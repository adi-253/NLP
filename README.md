Aspect-Based Stock Movement Prediction
Introduction
Aspect-Based Stock Movement Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict stock price movements based on multiple aspects of financial data. The model uses both numerical data (such as stock prices, volumes) and textual data (such as news headlines, financial reports) to predict whether a stock's price will increase or decrease. The textual data is processed through Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), allowing the model to assess how different aspects (e.g., company performance, market conditions) influence stock prices.

Key Features
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA): Extract sentiment on various aspects (e.g., management, market trends) from financial news and reports.
Stock Price Prediction: Use both numerical and textual features to predict stock price movements.
Deep Learning Models: Leverage advanced machine learning models like LSTM, BERT, or Transformer for prediction.
