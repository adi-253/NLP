# Sentiment Analysis and Aspect-Based Labeling of Financial News

This folder  contains two Jupyter notebooks for performing sentiment analysis and aspect-based labeling on financial news datasets. The goal of the project is to provide sentiment scores at two levels:
1. **Overall sentiment of the news**.
2. **Aspect-specific sentiment, categories, and labels**.

## Contents

- `sentiment-score.ipynb`: This notebook provides sentiment scores for entire sentences within financial news articles to get the overall sentiment of the news of each day.
- `aspect-extraction.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on aspect-based labeling, where aspects (keywords) in the news articles are extracted, categorized, and their  sentiment scores are calcuated.


##NOTE- It is ideal to run those two notebooks in kaggle. The links have been given in those two files.
